# Connect Four Coding Challenge

This was originally an onsite coding challenge from The Jonah Group, with a time limit of 1 hour and only to be done from a laptop on Eclipse without internet access.

After my attempt, I wished to do the program again in my spare time with a complete implementation to what they specified.

The rules of the game is standard Connect Four, you place down a piece in an attempt to get four in a sequence, whether they be in a row, column or diagonal while attempting to stop the other player from doing so.

This coding challenge is presumbly a demonstration of the proper use of data structures, algorithms and architecture.

The specifications of the program:
- Takes inputs for the amount of rows and columns and the appropriate checks to ensure they are valid and to notify the user if they aren't.

- Reads the player's moves and constantly updates and prints the board out to show the move done

- A simple AI that merely does random moves to go against the player

- Appropriate checks for checking if there are four pieces in a row/column/diagonal

- Appropriate Javadoc comments
